Hi there! I'm a GenAI technologist, front-end dev and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmRlnRVJD_4mZlMZmTNpK2A) content creator with a love for all things tech, especially GenAI and other futuristic stuff. You can find me geeking out over the latest gadgets or trying to teach my computer to do my job for me.
