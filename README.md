I'm @Timvdv, a front-end dev and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmRlnRVJD_4mZlMZmTNpK2A) personality with a love for all things tech, especially AI and other futuristic stuff. When I'm not busy making the web a better place, you can find me geeking out over the latest gadgets or trying to teach my computer to do my job for me.
